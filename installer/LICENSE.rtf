distributes such Contribution.\par
\par
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\par
\par
The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\par
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\par
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\par
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\par
Contributor:\par
\par
(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\par
    or\par
\par

    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\par
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\par
    Version); or\par
\par
(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\par
    its Contributions.\par
\par
This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\par
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\par
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\par
\par
2.4. Subsequent Licenses\par
\par
No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\par
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\par
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\par
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\par
\par
2.5. Representation\par
\par

Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\par
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\par
\par
2.6. Fair Use\par
\par
This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\par
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\par
equivalents.\par
\par
2.7. Conditions\par
\par
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\par
in Section 2.1.\par
\par
3. Responsibilities\par
-------------------\par
\par
3.1. Distribution of Source Form\par
\par
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\par
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\par
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\par
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\par
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\par
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\par
Form.\par
\par
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\par
\par
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\par
\par
(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\par
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\par
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\par
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\par
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\par
\par
(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\par
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\par
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\par
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\par
\par
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\par
\par
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\par
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\par
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\par
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\par
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\par
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\par
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\par
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\par
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\par
License(s).\par
\par
3.4. Notices\par
\par
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\par
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\par
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\par
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\par
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\par
\par
3.5. Application of Additional Terms\par
\par
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\par
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\par
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\par
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\par
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\par
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\par
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\par
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\par
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\par
jurisdiction.\par
\par
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\par
---------------------------------------------------\par
\par
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\par
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\par
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\par
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\par
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\par
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\par
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\par
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\par
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\par
\par
5. Termination\par
--------------\par
\par
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\par
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\par
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\par
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\par
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\par
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\par
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\par
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\par
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\par
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\par
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\par
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\par
Your receipt of the notice.\par
\par
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\par
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\par
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\par
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\par
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\par
2.1 of this License shall terminate.\par
\par
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\par
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\par
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\par
prior to termination shall survive termination.\par

*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *\par
*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *\par
*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *\par
*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *\par
*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *\par
*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *\par
*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *\par
*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *\par
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *\par
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *\par
*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *\par
*                                                                      *\par

*  7. Limitation of Liability                                          *\par
*  --------------------------                                          *\par
*                                                                      *\par
*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *\par
*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *\par
*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *\par
*  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *\par
*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *\par
*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *\par
*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *\par
*  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party      *\par
*  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This   *\par
*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *\par
*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *\par
*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *\par
*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *\par
*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *\par
*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *\par
*                                                                      *\par
************************************************************************\par
\par
8. Litigation\par
-------------\par
\par
Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\par
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\par
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\par
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\par
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\par
cross-claims or counter-claims.\par
\par
9. Miscellaneous\par
----------------\par
\par
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\par
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\par
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\par
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\par
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\par
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\par

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\par
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\par
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\par
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\par
such modified license differs from this License).\par
\par
